        "\n",
        "Large Language Models (LLMs) have reshaped natural language processing (NLP), offering powerful capabilities in tasks like information extraction (IE) from historical texts. Chat-based generative models completely change the way we can interact with and analyse our corpora. These models enable users to engage with training data using natural language, revolutionizing communication paradigms and propagating a wide adoption of AI-tools across text-based tasks. However, concerns about **data privacy**, and **access** have arisen due to the dominance of closed-source models from industry giants like OpenAI and Google. To address these issues, there's a growing interest in open-source alternatives, which provide transparency and control over models and data.\n",
        "\n",
        "This Jupyter Notebook explores the potential of open-source LLMs for NER and aspect recognition in historical texts. We'll showcase zero- and few-shot learning to overcome **data scarcity**, a pivotal problem in applying IE in literary-historical contexts. We aim to showcase how open-source LLMs can illuminate the past and shape the future of historical scholarship!\n",

He approached the City States of Italy for help. Florence, Milan, and Venice all refused to support his project. In hope, Columbus turned to the Kingdom of Portugal, but they too rejected him.
