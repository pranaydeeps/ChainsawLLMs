        "\n",
        "Large Language Models (LLMs) have reshaped natural language processing (NLP), offering powerful capabilities in tasks like information extraction (IE) from historical texts. Chat-based generative models completely change the way we can interact with and analyse our corpora. These models enable users to engage with training data using natural language, revolutionizing communication paradigms and propagating a wide adoption of AI-tools across text-based tasks. However, concerns about **data privacy**, and **access** have arisen due to the dominance of closed-source models from industry giants like OpenAI and Google. To address these issues, there's a growing interest in open-source alternatives, which provide transparency and control over models and data.\n",
        "\n",
        "This Jupyter Notebook explores the potential of open-source LLMs for NER and aspect recognition in historical texts. We'll showcase zero- and few-shot learning to overcome **data scarcity**, a pivotal problem in applying IE in literary-historical contexts. We aim to showcase how open-source LLMs can illuminate the past and shape the future of historical scholarship!\n",

Do not deviate from this schema.\\nThe sentence is indicated by <<<>>>.\\n\\nQuestion: Extract the relevant entities from the given sentence.\\nSentence: <<<The hill-city of Perugia supplies an instructive contrast with the\\nhill-city of Cortona. The obvious contrast in the matter of modern\\nprosperity and importance is an essential part of the comparative\\nhistory. Cortona has through all ages lived on, but not much more\\nthan lived on. Perugia has, through all ages, kept, if not a place\\nin the first rank of Italian cities, yet at any rate a high place in\\nthe second rank. She never had the European importance of Venice,\\nGenoa, Florence, Naples, and Milan, or of Pisa in her great days.\\nBut in the purely Italian history of all ages Perugia keeps herself\\nbefore our eyes, as a city of mark, from the wars of the growing Roman\\ncommonwealth down to the struggle which in our own days freed her from\\na second Roman yoke. In the civil wars of the old Rome, in the wars\\nbetween the Goth and the New Rome, in the long tale of the troubled\\ngreatness of mediæval Italy, Etruscan Perusia, Roman Augusta Perusia,\\nmediæval and modern Perugia, holds no mean place. And the last act\\nin the long drama is not the least notable. It sounds like a bit out\\nof Plutarch\\'s \"Life of Timoleôn,\" when we read or when we remember\\nhow, twice within our own days, little more than twenty and thirty\\nyears back, the fortress of the tyrants was swept away, as the great\\nsymbolic act which crowned the winning back of freedom in its newest\\nform. When a city has such a tale as this to tell, we do not expect, we\\ndo not wish, that its only or its chief interest should gather round\\nthe monuments of an early and almost præhistoric day of greatness. At\\nCortona we are glad that things Etruscan are undoubtedly uppermost.\\nAt Perugia we are glad that things Etruscan are there to be seen in\\nabundance; but we also welcome the monuments of Roman days, pagan\\nand Christian; we welcome the streets, the churches, and palaces of\\nmediæval times, and even the works of recent times indeed. The Place of\\nVictor Emmanuel with the modern buildings which crown it, supplanting\\nthe fortress of Pope Paul, as that supplanted the houses, churches, and\\npalaces of earlier times, is as much a part of the history of Perugia\\nas the Arch of Augustus or the Etruscan wall itself.>>>\\n\\nAnswer: {{{{\\'person\\': [\\'Plutarch\\', \\'Victor Emmanuel\\', \\'Pope Paul\\', \\'Augustus\\'],\\n     \\'location\\': [\\'Perugia\\', \\'Cortona\\', \\'Venice\\', \\'Genoa\\', \\'Florence\\', \\'Naples\\', \\'Milan\\', \\'Pisa\\', \\'Rome\\', \\'Italy\\', \\'Etruscan Perusia\\', \\'Roman Augusta Perusia\\'],}}}} '"
